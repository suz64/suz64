Introduction
This guide is intended for beginners with little to no prior programming experience. We aim to provide a clear and structured introduction to C programming, covering essential topics that will form the foundation of your programming journey.

Getting Started
Setting Up Your Development Environment
To start coding in C, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps to get started:

Install a C compiler (e.g., GCC)

Choose a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks)

Verify your installation by running a simple "Hello, World!" program

Writing Your First Program
We'll begin with the classic "Hello, World!" program to familiarize you with the basic structure of a C program. Follow the instructions in the HelloWorld.c file to write and run your first program.

Basic Concepts
Variables and Data Types
Learn about different data types in C and how to declare and use variables. Check out the VariablesAndDataTypes.c file for examples.

Control Structures
Understand how to control the flow of your program using conditional statements and loops. See the ControlStructures.c file for detailed examples.

Functions
Explore how to create and use functions to make your code modular and reusable. Refer to the Functions.c file for practical examples.

Basic Input/Output Operations
Get hands-on experience with basic input and output operations in C. Review the BasicIO.c file for sample code.

Practice Exercises
Put your knowledge to the test with these practice exercises:

Exercise 1: Simple Calculator

Exercise 2: Temperature Converter

Exercise 3: Fibonacci Sequence Generator
